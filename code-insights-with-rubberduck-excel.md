# Code Insights with Rubberduck + Excel

Rubberduck's test results and Code Explorer data export to Excel via clipboard for analysis and visualization.

Test results copied to clipboard can be pasted into worksheets and converted to data tables. Excel's Recommended Charts feature (Insert ribbon tab) suggests visualizations. Count of method by component charts identify test modules with more test methods. Sum of duration by component charts reveal longer-executing test modules. Test categories, archived results, and aggregation enable performance profiling of problematic scenarios.

Code Explorer's "Copy to Clipboard" button exports project data tables to Excel. Recommended pivot tables provide detailed project breakdowns. Count of names by declaration type pivot tables list all Rubberduck declaration types, quantifying line labels, `Declare Function` imports, and other elements.

Filtering and creativity enable regrouping Constant, Function, PropertyGet, and Variable declarations by return type, identifying all `Variant` returns.

Timestamped data exported to Access or SQL Server databases feeds dashboards or reports showing project growth over time.
