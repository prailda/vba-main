# "I'm not a programmer"

VBA code written by office professionals often carries the disclaimer "I'm not a programmer." However, designing efficient, reliable, and maintainable worksheets requires the same problem-solving methodology as programming: dissecting problems into discrete steps and modeling solutions.

Worksheet design demonstrates programming principles. When constructing formulas, considerations include range extensibility, data integrity through validation lists sourced from named ranges, and clear documentation for critical dependencies. These practices—anticipating extension points, facilitating maintenance, making systems harder to break—constitute programming fundamentals.

Worksheets are programs. Excel's dynamic arrays further align worksheet function design with functional programming paradigms.

VBA code, however, is frequently held to a lower standard. The "it works, therefore it's good enough" criterion applies neither to professional worksheet design nor to production code.

Code quality standards transcend procedural versus object-oriented paradigms. Good code adheres to language-agnostic principles applicable to all procedural code. Code should be readable and maintainable by colleagues with basic VBA knowledge, even at higher abstraction levels.

Not every VBA procedure requires object-oriented patterns, dependency injection, or excessive class modules. However, VBA code quality should match the quality standards applied to worksheets, dashboards, and database reports. Code intended for eventual IT staff maintenance benefits from the same attention to quality as any other professional deliverable.
